3Part Harmony 2035 in 9 parts...a Cento This poem was written at an "Imagination Station" during the 3rd Annual Farm festival at Three Part Harmony Farm (http://threepartharmonyfarm.org/) Held October 17th, 2015 for the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture's (http://usdac.us) #DARETOIMAGINE project (http://dare-to-imagine.us/).
